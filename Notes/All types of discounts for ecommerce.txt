All types of discounts for ecommerce


Yes, many e-commerce platforms include discount fields in their product database schema, allowing discounts to apply automatically or based on specific conditions. Here are some common practices for managing discounts in e-commerce systems:

Discount Field in the Product Database: Each product can have a dedicated discount field, typically expressed as a percentage or a fixed amount. For example, a 10% discount might be stored as discount: 10, or as a specific currency value off the original price.

Tiered Discounts Based on Conditions: Some platforms define discount rules based on various criteria such as quantity (buy more, save more), seasonal promotions, or membership levels. These rules are stored in a separate discount_rules table and linked to products or categories, allowing the system to apply discounts dynamically.

Coupon Codes and Promo Codes: Coupon codes are typically stored in a coupons table, which includes fields like code, discount_type (percentage or fixed), amount, and validity_period. The cart system checks for a valid coupon and applies it across eligible items or the entire cart.

Discounted Price Storage: Some e-commerce systems store both the original price and a pre-calculated discounted price in the database. This approach reduces on-the-fly calculations and helps improve performance by directly retrieving the discounted price if available.

Campaign-Based Discounts: For large-scale promotions, discounts may be applied at the category or store-wide level. In this case, theyâ€™re stored in a campaigns or promotions table, often associated with categories rather than individual products.
